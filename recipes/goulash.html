        <h1>American Goulash</h1>
        <img>
        <p>
            American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I was growing up.
            They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of buttered white bread and a carton
            of milk. This Americanized version oif goulash was invented to stretch a small amount of beef
            into enough food for a not-so-small family. It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple,
            so it's perfect for your weeknight dinner rotation.

                until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
                Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic,
                bay leaves, paprika, italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.

                Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come togther, about 3 minutes. Pour
                in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl,
                and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce, bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium
                and simmer until falvors intensify, about 30 minutes.

                Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in maraconi; cook,
                stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about 12 minutes. Check for doneness
                after 10 minutes.

            <li>
                Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and parsley. Cover and let rest
                for 5 minutes. Taste and season as desired.
